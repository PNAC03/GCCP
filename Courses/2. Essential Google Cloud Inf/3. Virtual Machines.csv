571535,multiple-choice,What are sustained use discounts?,2097933,Discounts you receive by using preemptible VM instances,false,That's incorrect. Discounts on preemptible VM instances are unrelated to sustained use discounts.,2097930,Automatic discounts that you get for running specific Compute Engine resources for a significant portion of the billing month,true,"That's correct! Sustained use discounts are automatic discounts that you get for running specific Compute Engine resources (vCPUs, memory, GPU devices) for a significant portion of the billing month. To take advantage of the full 30% discount, create your VM instances on the first day of the month, because discounts reset at the beginning of each month.",2097932,Purchase commitments for specific resources you know you will use,false,"That's incorrect, those would be committed use discounts.",2097935,Per-second billing that starts after a 1 minute minimum,false,That's incorrect. This statement is true for any VM instance but has nothing to do with sustained use discounts.
571533,multiple-choice,Which statement is true of Virtual Machine Instances in Compute Engine?,2097927,"In Compute Engine, a VM is a networked service that simulates the features of a computer.",true,"VMs in Compute Engine are a collection of networked services which includes persistent disks that are network-attached. In some cases the Google Cloud VM behaves unlike hardware or other kinds of virtual machines, for example, when a multi-tenant virtual CPU ""bursts"", using excess capacity beyond the VM spec.",2097925,A VM in Compute Engine always maps to a single hardware computer in a rack.,false,That's incorrect. I recommend going back to the lectures of this module to review this concept.,2097926,Compute Engine uses VMware to create Virtual Machine Instances.,false,I recommend reviewing the lectures in this module.,2097928,All Compute Engine VMs are single tenancy and do not share CPU hardware.,false,That is not the right answer. Please go back and review the lectures in this module.
571536,multiple-choice,Which statement is true of persistent disks?,2097938,Persistent disks are always HDDs (magnetic spinning disks).,false,I recommend reviewing the lectures in this module.,2097936,Persistent disks are encrypted by default.,true,"Persistent Disks are not physical disks, they are a virtual-networked service. Each persistent disk remains encrypted either with system-defined keys or with customer-supplied keys.",2097937,Persistent disks are physical hardware devices connected directly to VMs.,false,That's incorrect. I recommend going back to the lectures of this module to review this concept.,2097939,"Once created, a persistent disk cannot be resized.",false,That is not the right answer. Please go back and review the lectures in this module.
