571532,multiple-choice,What is one benefit of applying firewall rules by tag rather than by address?,2097923,Tags on firewall rules control which ephemeral IP addresses VMs will receive.,false,That is not the right answer. Please go back and review the lectures in this module.,2097924,"When a VM is created with a matching tag, the firewall rules apply irrespective of the IP address it is assigned.",true,"When a VM is created the ephemeral external IP address is assigned from a pool. There is no way to predict which address will be assigned, so there is no way to write a rule that will match that VM's IP address before it is assigned. Tags allow a symbolic assignment that does not depend on order in the IP addresses. It makes for simpler, more general, and easier to maintain, firewall rules.",2097921,Tags help organizations track firewall billing.,false,That's incorrect.

571530,multiple-choice,"In Google Cloud, what is the minimum number of IP addresses that a VM instance needs?",2097916,"Three: One internal, one external and one alias IP address",false,That's incorrect. Please go back and review the lectures in this module.,2097914,One: Only an internal IP address,true,"That's correct! In Google Cloud, each virtual machine needs to have an internal IP address. The external IP address is optional; therefore, a VM instance only needs one IP address.",2097915,Two: One internal and one external IP address,false,That's incorrect. I recommend going back to the lectures of this module to review this concept.,,,,
571531,multiple-choice,What are the three types of networks offered in Google Cloud?,2097919,"Default network, auto network, and custom network.",true,"The three network types offered by Google Cloud are: default, auto and custom. Each project starts with a default network. The auto-type network uses the same subnet IP ranges as the default-type, with a network name other than default. A custom-type allows you to specify the IP ranges of subnets.",2097920,"IPv4 unicast network, IPv4 multicast network, IPv6 network",false,That is not the right answer. Please go back and review the lectures in this module.,2097917,"Zonal, regional, and global",false,That's incorrect.
